This project it's intended as a challenge to put together a website from various APIs and dependencies. This includes making function that calls to Google Maps and other location based services like Foursquare.

On the left there will be a short list of filters that was meaningful places in my youth. 

The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations on the map with a marker that it is dynamic.

## Features

2. Search through availaible locations.
3. Get information on locations from the search or through marker click
